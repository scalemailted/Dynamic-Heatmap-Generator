# Dynamic Heatmap Generator

The Dynamic Heatmap Generator is a web application that allows users to generate and visualize different types of dynamic heatmaps. This app provides a simple user interface to input parameters, generate heatmap data, and visualize the results in an interactive way.

## Features

- Generate heatmaps based on various algorithms:
  - Evolutionary Spatial Rules
  - Evolutionary Temporal Rules
  - Random Weighted with No Constraints
  - Random Weighted with Proximity Constraints
- Customize parameters to suit specific needs
- Interactive visualization with a slider to navigate through time steps
- Play and pause functionality for heatmap animation
- Download heatmap data as a JSON file

## How to Use

1. Open the web app and select a heatmap type from the dropdown menu.
2. Provide the general parameters (length, width, cell size, and snapshots) for the heatmap.
3. Enter the specific parameters for the chosen heatmap type.
4. Click the "Generate" button to create the heatmap.
5. Use the slider or input box to navigate through time steps and visualize the heatmap at different points in time.
6. Press the "Play" button to animate the heatmap, and "Pause" to stop the animation.
7. Click the "Download" button to download the heatmap data as a JSON file.

## Dependencies

This web app uses the following libraries:

- [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Custom JavaScript scripts for heatmap generation and visualization

## Examples

The Dynamic Heatmap Generator can be used for a variety of applications, such as visualizing:

- Evolution of cellular automata
- Social network communities
- Localized disease outbreaks
- Regional wildlife migration patterns

Explore the different heatmap types and customize the parameters to create insightful visualizations for your specific use case.
